Because of my intention to wake at 2AM, I had refused taking dinner yesterday, and asked that it be reserved until this morning. I guess I just couldn't help the sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I visited IRC yesterday, I enquired about "hacks for reading". The answer I got was a link to a &lt;a href="http://english.glendale.cc.ca.us/speed1.html"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt;. Visiting that page today, I found these awesome speed reading tips: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-scan the material, before actually reading thouroughly. Get an overview of the main points/headings/subheadings beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read with intent. Once you have a grasp of the main ideas, you can read with an inquisitive mindset. Question the main points, and read as if you are searching for answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kill the voice in your head ... and mouth! Avoid vocalization and sub-vocalization; let your brain do the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read in word clusters (phrases), rather than word after word. This needs some getting used to, as I've seen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid re-reading the same phrases again. Reading should be forward ever, and almost backward never.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand that every material may not be read with the same speed. E.g newspapers can be read pretty fast, whereas technical stuff may not be read so fast, but in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surfing the net, I also found some &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Comb-an-Afro"&gt;hair-combing tips&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mosturize the hair (dampen it with water) before combing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply a generous amount of oil (Olive oil in my case)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comb gently (backwards or forwards), starting from the ends, and repeating until the roots (scalp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time on the road today going from where I live, Bariga, to Ajah, both in Lagos State. I managed to catch some sleep on the road, and also do some reading -- I read a portion of a book I'm currently reading -- &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12232938-the-lovely-bones"&gt;"The Lovely Bones"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a vigil at the church tonight.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tosin Damilare James Animashaun</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2016 23:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:takwas.github.io,2016-01-09:article/life-log-05-january-2016.html</guid><category>life</category><category>journal</category><category>diary</category></item><item><title>Life-Log 6: January 6, 2016</title><link>http://takwas.github.io/article/life-log-06-january-2016.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There hasn't  been much activity today. Since returning in the morning from the vigil I attended last night combined with an early morning church service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister returned to school today. I had accompanied my aunt to drop her off at the park. On our way back from there, I alighted from the vehicle to pay a quick visit to the market, where I bought a few things before returning home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pondering on the notions of &lt;em&gt;bliss&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nothingness&lt;/em&gt; today. The concept of "nothingness" was inspired by a "TEDcast"  -- that's &lt;em&gt;TED&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;podcast&lt;/em&gt; :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel I don't attain bliss because of my usual mood combinations: I'm usually either &lt;strong&gt;excited/jovial and loud&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;angry and extremely quiet/taciturn&lt;/strong&gt;. But what I desire as the perfect combo for me is &lt;strong&gt;joy and quietude&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How I wish I'd be so happy and quietly, gracefully appreciate the &lt;em&gt;art&lt;/em&gt; of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thought that came up today was that of my outward personality. I grew up thinking my own didn't appreciate me. That the strangers (some of whom have become friends) I was introduced to were the ones who loved me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I realise that I am only clothed when I go out, and people simply adore my neat appearance. Back at my source called home, I am fully naked and the attitude I put up is the real me -- no makeup attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the people here (at home) have been able to put up with me until now, then I feel I should show some appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also thought of curating a list of must learn Python modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to get acquainted with testing and packaging in Python. So I have been putting some time into learning this.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tosin Damilare James Animashaun</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2016 23:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:takwas.github.io,2016-01-09:article/life-log-06-january-2016.html</guid><category>life</category><category>journal</category><category>diary</category></item><item><title>Life-Log 4: January 4, 2016</title><link>http://takwas.github.io/article/life-log-04-january-2016.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; woke up at exactly 2AM. I think two things I did yesterday made it easy for me to wake up that early: one, I had siesta; and two, I didn't eat dinner. I have noticed you gain more control over your night time sleep when you fail to eat supper. If you must eat however, I would reckon you go with something extremely light; even a beverage should suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon waking up, I checked Facebook, and was thrill-inspired by the status that appeared at the very top. It was by the creator of Facebook himself, Mark Zuckerberg. How inspiring it is to learn that someone of that calibre still gave himself a book reading challenge -- he did so last year -- and on top of that, gave himself a new goal of building an AI for the new year -- he specifically said he'll do the coding himself, not instruct a technical team to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But it's a different kind of rewarding to build things yourself, so this year my personal challenge is to do that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next few hours cleaning up some not-yet-published scribbles and blog posts. I tried to code, but ended up just doing a little bit of reading, then returning to sleep at about 5AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up again at about 7AM. I grabbed my breakfast pretty early, and then set off to do some much overdue laundry. That plus some other other cleaning chores took some hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I spent the rest of the day at my aunt's shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, I spent some time learning about &lt;a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/"&gt;how to test code in Python&lt;/a&gt;. I learnt about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://pythontesting.net/framework/unittest/unittest-introduction/"&gt;unit testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://pythontesting.net/framework/doctest-introduction/#example"&gt;doc testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the latter being the easier one in my opinion. I also peeked into the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/index.html"&gt;twisted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; networking library which I'll need for coding my IRC bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I learned that it's good practice to keep "running code" (script) separate from algorithm code and data-handling code.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tosin Damilare James Animashaun</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2016 11:35:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:takwas.github.io,2016-01-07:article/life-log-04-january-2016.html</guid><category>life</category><category>journal</category><category>diary</category></item><item><title>Life-Log 3: January 3, 2016</title><link>http://takwas.github.io/article/life-log-03-january-2016.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I didn't read the bible this morning, but the family had a morning devotion as usual. My sleep was a rather short one, spanning about three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the devotion, I got ready for church service. I got to the church at exactly 9AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't called up to interpret during the service, in fact, no youth was. The interpretion was done by one of the elders, Elder Ogunkomaya. I would think this had to do with the service being the first Sunday service for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the first Sunday of the year, one would expect some sort of thanksgiving service. That it was, but only slightly. I guess the full package isn't until the first Sunday in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two prophecies, and one of them mentioned that, the service need not be rushed. This is worthy of note because, prior to both prophecies, the pastor had asked the prophets to keep their prophecies short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sermon was tagged "Unselfish Desires ...". While I particularly liked this topic, I wasn't very pleased with some of the prayer points that followed. In my opinion, they seemed rather contradictory to the theme of the sermon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I had a much needed siesta -- something I'm very grateful for. I slept off while listening to a &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_tells_us_why_we_love_cheat?language=en"&gt;third TED talk&lt;/a&gt; of the afternoon. I really enjoyed &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en"&gt;one of the talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, that talked about "choice". I found the talk interesting because I could easily agree with the speaker's postulations. During his presentation, the speaker, Barry Schwartz said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was woken from my sleep afterwards by my pastor's son, Tosin. He had been sent to fetch me. My pastor's wife and children had to travel the following morning, so needed some gas in their car for the trip. For this I drove out to get some petrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just before I could drive out, an incidence caused some delay. His son had carelessly locked the car key in the vehicle; alas, there were no spare keys. So this became the hurdle we had to face for the next 30-45 minutes. What's more: he had ignited the vehicle just before locking it in, so the car was running the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, with the help of a few folks -- good thing to be a &lt;em&gt;good pastor&lt;/em&gt;; lots of folks came around to help very quickly -- we got a metal bar into the door and removed the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over two hours later, I got the fuel, but not while I drove around searching. I had returned in disappointment and parked the car. In our little gas-haunting adventure, we had failed to obtain that which we sought for owing to general scarcity. In fact, on three occasions, we were told that the fuel in the station's supply was exhausted when it was only a couple of cars to our turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In eventual frustration, I managed to get the car back home with the little fuel left in it. Afterwards, I left with my gallon in a commercial tricycle headed in a different direction as the one I had previously traveled in. Surprisingly, I met a newly opened petrol station only a minute or two into the journey. They were eagerly distributing the scarce commodity to their new customers; I too joined the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a different note, my sister returned home from my cousins' a few minutes before I got back home. She came back with a diary and calender for me, which I very much appreciate. What I need to complete that set is a wrist-watch in a bid to be well organised in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

For whatever reasons, it wasn't until one of my alarms went off at &lt;strong&gt;5.15AM&lt;/strong&gt; that I got up to realize that the power had long been supplied. At the time, my cousin, Deji was watching Sky Sports in the parlour area of the living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On waking up I read the bible. This is something I have not been doing consistently, however, this time, I don't intend to rush through this; so I'm taking it very slow and hopefully steady. I read thirteen verses: &lt;strong&gt;Genesis 1.1-13&lt;/strong&gt;. These verses describe the &lt;strong&gt;first three days of Creation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I reminded myself of my plan to begin reading academic papers today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aunt and the rest of the family, on waking up, joined us in the living room, and we said our morning prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a Saturday, it was only natural that we would do some sanitation. And so that followed. I did spend 'extra' amount of time cleaning and reassembling my small makeshift wardrobe (testament to my obsessions with cleaning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At noon, I had my meal, and went on to spend some time on IRC while doing some other regular things I would do usually do on my computer: sort files, check code and repos on &lt;a href="http://github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, read code, surf the web sourcing more and more general knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was on IRC, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;empdokles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (an IRC buddy) asked if we could work together on an application messaging extension for &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt;. I think it's a great idea that would also require quite a bit of a learning curve. For instance, neither of us is good with Javascript, but our intended application would definitely need it, so we'd need to learn that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, I was able to fix a small bug with my blog that was caused by conflicting options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to time and upcoming events, I under pressure to contribute code to my team's projects, particularly &lt;strong&gt;project &lt;em&gt;jobnownow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the one we intend to get out as soon as possible. I am only trying to be calm and organized, as when the year's activities are fully resumed, &lt;em&gt;time would become a wilder horse to tame&lt;/em&gt;, something, obvious though it seems, I thank my mother for pointing my blinded attention to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I still have quite a lot of things lined up. Some might be done, and some I may have to let go. Among them, four projects for my team -- one is a hospital information management system application for a client. I also have a pending Java certification examination, the OCAJP 1Z0-803 examination, which was again postponed until mid-January 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I have entreprenuerial and Python meetups which I signed up for last year. I also have my eyes -- but not my mind -- on the &lt;a href="http://cchubnigeria.com/blog/"&gt;BBC Africa's ideas workshop&lt;/a&gt; scheduled for later this month at CcHub, Yaba. And very recently, a co-developer acquaintance at NIIT informed me of Facebook's &lt;a href="https://www.internet.org/innovationchallenge"&gt;app innovation challenge&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="http://internet.org"&gt;Internet.org&lt;/a&gt; for Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the &lt;a href="https://djangogirls.org/lagos/"&gt;DjangoGirls web development workshop&lt;/a&gt; coming up. I signed up for this as a mentor last December after learning about the event via the Python-Nigeria mailing list. This one won't hold until February 2016 though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside these events, I have plans to code my own IRC bot. So I'm making efforts towards that as well. At the moment, I am trying to write unit tests for an open source bot, &lt;a href="http://github.com/takwas/theb0t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ekan0ra&lt;/em&gt; (aka &lt;em&gt;batul&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. I also started working on my own bot last year: &lt;a href="http://github.com/takwas/sawkat"&gt;sawkat&lt;/a&gt;. I have begun learning about the &lt;a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted"&gt;&lt;code&gt;twisted&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Python library which is used for coding IRC clients and bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a different note, I delayed my new year greetings messages until about 10PM. And that's when I unleashed them to their respective recipients. I'm sure the reponses would be flooding in by morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past 12AM, I got to reading the introductory part of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roy Fielding's&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; well known dissertation on software architecting, particulary because it is also widely recommended to anyone looking to fully comprehend and build &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"&gt;RESTful APIs&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to this, I had no idea what the typical size of an academic dissertation was; I had projected something under 20 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my disappointment, I opened Roy's work to behold a close-to-200-page work. As a result of this, I have now rethought my paper reading plan. I will no longer try to complete one paper per day. Instead, I'll spread these papers across days and try to read them through. So help me God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Last night, a few hours before 12AM, we (me and my aunt's family) were at the church. Church service lasted till just after new year -- about 12.20AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got home and I broke my day-long food break (no pun intended). I had some malt (Amstel Malta) -- I didn't get one to buy at the time we left church. I would later refuse to take any of the fizzy drinks offered during lunch because of this; plus I felt (for sentimental reasons) that my aunt might not have been pleased I took one of the malt drinks (there were four cans, and I had one of them) in the refrigerator -- and milk (Hollandia Milk, sold for 130 naira). We had prayers, and then it was the next meal round for me. I had some &lt;em&gt;garri&lt;/em&gt; and chicken, which of course, my aunt handed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, getting up at about 6AM, we kick started the day. We were to attend church is the practice at my aunt's church. I have partaken in that, the last two years. So I went on to wash the two cars -- my aunts' and her husbands'. We left the house after 9 O'Clock, and when we arrived at the church, it was already 10AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first-day-of-the-year program is usually geared towards the announcement of a new &lt;strong&gt;anchor&lt;/strong&gt; -- something we chant in faith, at the end of every church service, all year round. Amongst other things, the anchor's declaration is usually preceded by about three prophecies. And so it was today. The announcement came in the third: &lt;strong&gt;"O God: Thou art my HELP, and my DELIVERER"&lt;/strong&gt;; a declaration drawn out of Psalm 70 vs 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rest of the family, I left the church after 4PM, after having stayed in traffic for about an hour. We had left Folabi and Dapo -- two of my cousins -- at the church. They would much later, much to their surprise, find their way home themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, I got a call from my pastor -- Pastor Odusina -- to check up on his phone, and help fix an issue. Alas, the issue was that his newly installed Skype app wasn't connecting to the internet, and was displaying an "offline" status. When, I got there, it just worked without me touching it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently helped purchase a new smartphone for my pastor's wife, and offered to help diagnose her laggy old phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were the activities that took up most of my evening, even until just before now (current system time: 21.54) that I'm writing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to hack some code tonight, but there is no power supply at the moment; this battery'll only last a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my plans for 2016, I hope to read a paper a day as a way to become ever more read and deepen my insight in my autodidactic journey. I haven't read any today, but I found some &lt;a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love"&gt;very awesome resource on Github&lt;/a&gt;, a curation of computer science based academic papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am crowdsourcing for paper suggestions. I welcome you to contribute your to-read paper/essay suggestions in the comments. I also have &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-recommended-list-of-essays-papers-to-read-one-per-day-in-2016-for-an-autodidact-who-wants-to-widen-his-horizon-but-focus-on-Soft-Engr?share=1"&gt;this question on Quora&lt;/a&gt; where you may also post your answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Quora, I found &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Obinna-Okechukwu"&gt;this really interesting profile&lt;/a&gt; on Quora minutes after returning from the new year cross-over church service. He has a &lt;a href="https://tcsnotes.quora.com/"&gt;Quora-hosted blog&lt;/a&gt;, where he reviews or puts details of Computer Science papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/James-L-Moyer?share=1"&gt;this other guy&lt;/a&gt; -- creator of &lt;a href="http://www.TheAutodidactLife.com"&gt;AutodidactLife&lt;/a&gt; -- who encouraged me to read transcripts of TED talks. His answers on Quora show that he has some insightful knowledge on autodidactism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More personally, I didn't speak with my mum today -- something I find rather strange for the first day of the year, but I did call my grandma and sister. My sister, Tobi, is with a cousin (Aunt Ladun) for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tosin Damilare James Animashaun</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2016 11:35:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:takwas.github.io,2016-01-01:article/life-log-01-january-2016.html</guid><category>life</category><category>journal</category><category>diary</category></item><item><title>Slack is Tweak-friendly</title><link>http://takwas.github.io/article/migrating-slack-channel-general.html</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How I migrated the locked default channel on Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://slack.com"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; is a communication platform built for teams. While it is free by default, there are features reserved for paid users. However, the free version already comes with a ton of cool features, and is highly usable as is, especially for teams that are relatively small. My team has stuck with this unpaid version of the application for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, we decided to have our clients join our Slack team, with some envisaged benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would ease the process of keeping the client up-to-date on project progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would bring our clients to our preferred communication platform, bringing them all in one place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could leverage some of the many tools available for use with Slack to improve our communication with clients. It's worth noting that Slack is very API friendly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In doing this, we were presented with a small challenge. All of our previous conversations which had mostly being in the public, general channel, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;#general&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, were now open to our newly signed-on client. Some of these conversations obviously included stuff we would rather be more privy about. This meant I had to quickly find a way to &lt;em&gt;migrate&lt;/em&gt; -- I chose not to &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt; -- the messages in the hope that he had not scrolled back through the channel's message log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would have been easier if Slack allowed certain modifications to the default channel named &lt;em&gt;#general&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For instance, Slack prevents the deletion of this channel. On top of that, Slack puts some restrictions on private channels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can't be &lt;a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/213185307-Deleting-a-channel"&gt;deleted, but can be &lt;em&gt;archived&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can't be changed to &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; channels even though the reverse is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
These limitations notwithstanding, the following explains my approach to tackling the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I used Slack's &lt;a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201658943-Exporting-your-team-s-Slack-history"&gt;export&lt;/a&gt; feature to backup all of our conversations, including channel information. A caveat here is, &lt;em&gt;Slack does not include private channels' data with exported data by default&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[2]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but thankfully, we hadn't any private rooms at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Slack exports team data in JSON format, making it very easy to work with. Having downloaded the exported data, I started looking through it for parts that I could tweak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some top-level (&lt;strong&gt;root folder&lt;/strong&gt;) files which included meta-data about users, teams and channels. Then there were also folders for each channel, in which, conversation logs were kept, grouped by days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I edited the &lt;code&gt;channels.json&lt;/code&gt; file in the top-level directory, and changed the name of the channel &lt;em&gt;#general&lt;/em&gt;, which contained the messages, to some new name. Then I went and renamed the folder named &lt;code&gt;general&lt;/code&gt;, to this new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these changes in place, I compressed the modified files alongside the unmodified ones into a &lt;em&gt;zip&lt;/em&gt; archive; the original Slack-exported data had come in a zip file as well. Slack allows you to &lt;a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201748703-Importing-message-history"&gt;import&lt;/a&gt; this zip file into your Slack team, which was what I did next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the import, Slack automatically tried to match detected channels (from the import) with existing ones, after-which I was presented with a page that displayed the mapping suggestions. I simply set it not to map but create new channels instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon successful completion of the imports, I went on to delete all the messages in the existing &lt;em&gt;#general&lt;/em&gt; channel. Those messages were now the contents of a newly minted channel, created using the new name I previously gave to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these in place, I did two more things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I edited and marked the new channel as &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I welcomed our new client to our Slack space &lt;strong&gt;;) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;[1] More on Slack's default channel - #general&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all love to make the computer do things exactly the way we want, so some of us choose to take the bold step of learning to communicate with the machine. And it is not uncommon to find many of our burgeoning kind go from &lt;em&gt;location to location on the web space&lt;/em&gt; trying to get help along the way. We are prompt to ask questions when we sight help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you learn to program, you are often encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;learn by doing.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain of computer programming or software development is a very practical one. Before now, I had carried this very principle everywhere with me -- in fact, preached it -- but hadn't really put it to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about learning languages (or technologies) by reading big manuals is that, often times, beginners will approach the process like they would any other literature book. But that is clearly a wrong approach as empirical evidence has shown. You don't read these things to simply stomach them. Instead, you swallow and then post-process. In essence, you ruminate over stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, the only way you can really process what you read is to &lt;strong&gt;try things out and see results for yourself&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks ago, while building an app, I visited IRC frequently to ask questions on just about everything that was unclear to me. While this mode of communication and seeking help is encouraged, abuse of it is strongly discouraged. The good guys over on the IRC channels get pissed off when it appears you're boycotting available resources like documentation, preferring to be spoonfed the whole time. (Remember this is not &lt;a href="http://www.quora.com"&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt;, where the philosophy is for you to ask more and more questions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the sort of thing that happened to me when I began &lt;em&gt;flooding&lt;/em&gt; the channels with my persistent querying. Most of the time the IRC folks kept pointing me to the documentation, as workarounds for most of the issues I had were already documented. A lot of things became much clearer when I decided to finally &lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/"&gt;read-the-docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did I learn from that? &lt;strong&gt;"Do your own research!"&lt;/strong&gt; It's so easy to skip this part, but if you make efforts at finding things out for yourself, you'll be surprised at how much you can dig out without having to bug people. However, this does not guarantee that even the few important questions you'll ask may not be met with hostility, but do not let that discourage you. The people who appear to be unwelcoming are doing so only as a way to discourage you from being over-dependent on the channel.
Another advantage of finding things for yourself is that, you learn the &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; and not just the &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's fair to quote &lt;a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/about/"&gt;Armin Ronacher&lt;/a&gt; here,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And it's not just asking questions; questioning other people, like what other people do or what you do yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far, the worst parts in all of my libraries are where I took the design from somewhere else. And it's not because I know better, it's because pretty much everything everybody does at any point in time has some sort of design decision behind it ... that major decision process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So someone came up with a solution for a particular problem, and he thought about it and then wrote it down. But if you look at someone else's design, you might no longer understand why the decision was made in the first place. And ... in fact, if the original implementation is ten years old, who knows if the design ideas behind it are still entirely correct."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Personally, I like to answer questions and help put people on track. Nonetheless, if the queries got too overwhelming -- especially coming from the same person -- I would eventually lose interest in answering questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Let me remind you of some &lt;strong&gt;tidbits or etiquettes of IRC&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construct your questions well (concise, well written and straight-to-the-point questions are more likely to attract help)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't EVER post code in a channel! &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin"&gt;Pastebin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it and share the link in the channel instead. While at it, don't post your entire code (unless you specifically need to). Post only the relevant portion -- the one you have an issue with. The only exception to this is if the snippet of code is considerably short, say one or two lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't be overly respectful. Yes, dont be too respectful -- &lt;em&gt;cut all the 'Sirs'&lt;/em&gt;. Only be moderately polite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure you have and use a registered nick. This gives you an identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last one is entirely my opinion but it's also based on what I have observed. &lt;strong&gt;Don't just be a leech, try to contribute to the community&lt;/strong&gt;. Answer questions when you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do you look to before looking to IRC? There are three sources you may &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt; from before turning to internet-relay-chat for help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the documentation&lt;/strong&gt;. * Documentation is the manual the creator or experts of a software product or tool provide their users with. So you want to know the ins and outs of a technology? That's the right place to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read blog posts&lt;/strong&gt; related to your topic-area. Blog posts are often based on people's experiences, so you're likely to find help from there, especially if the writer has faced the same issue. Remember to &lt;code&gt;bookmark&lt;/code&gt; the really helpful ones as you go ;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last and very important. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/"&gt;Read the source code!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This is two-fold: First is actually looking into your own code carefully and seeing what syntax or semantic errors you might have made. Secondly, you look into the original code of libraries/frameworks you are using if they are open source, otherwise revert to documentation. With this, you have it all stripped to its bare bones. Point blank! The source code reveals everything you need to know, once you know how to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
So why not arm yourself properly before going to post that question. That way, you would not only make it easier to get help [for yourself], but you would be better informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;[1] Some Pastebin platforms I use:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://pastebin.com"&gt;Pastebin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://hastebin.com"&gt;Hastebin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com"&gt;Ubuntu Pastebin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://pastie.org"&gt;Pastie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://paste.pound-python.org"&gt;Spacepaste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://paste.linux.chat"&gt;##Linux on Freenode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;a href="http://github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; provides a platform which supports version-controlled pastes: &lt;a href="http://gist.github/com"&gt;Github Gists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Because &lt;a href="http://hastebin.com"&gt;Hastebin&lt;/a&gt; heavily depends on Javascript, some people have complained of text-rendering issues possibly arising from browser-compatibility issues with it. So take caution using it. That said, I love its ease-of-use. It supports the use of keyboard shortcuts such as &lt;code&gt;[Ctrl]+[S]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tosin Damilare James Animashaun</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2015 12:10:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:takwas.github.io,2015-12-15:article/readying-for-net-help.html</guid><category>irc</category><category>help</category><category>programming</category><category>beginner</category><category>pastebin</category><category>documentation</category><category>practice</category><category>dev</category><category>planet</category></item></channel></rss>
