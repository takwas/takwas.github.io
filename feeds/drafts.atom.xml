&lt;p&gt;I engaged a ooleague, who is an expatriate for a few minutes, and what started out
as a XXX turned into a long winding conversation that was centered about the growth 
non-growth of the country. I will call him Raheem for the sake of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent 12-13 year in Nigeria, Raheem has done a fair amount of time required 
to become a citizen in most countries. He has understudied a lot of the culture 
as well as the business culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made a statement which inspired the title of this post, "Nigeria has more 
resources than anywhere else. Resources are everywhere. You can reach them with 
little effort."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to do go find a list of the 10 most abundtly availble resources in nigeria,
as well as which other countries have them just for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
