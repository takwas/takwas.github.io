My sleep was a rather short one, spanning about three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the devotion, I got ready for church service. I got to the church at exactly 9AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't called up to interpret during the service, in fact, no youth was. The interpretion was done by one of the elders, Elder Ogunkomaya. I would think this had to do with the service being the first Sunday service for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the first Sunday of the year, one would expect some sort of thanksgiving service. That it was, but only slightly. I guess the full package isn't until the first Sunday in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two prophecies, and one of them mentioned that, the service need not be rushed. This is worthy of note because, prior to both prophecies, the pastor had asked the prophets to keep their prophecies short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sermon was tagged "Unselfish Desires ...". While I particularly liked this topic, I wasn't very pleased with some of the prayer points that followed. In my opinion, it was a case of "why ...an already ..." as they seemed rather contradictory to the theme of the sermon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I had a much needed siesta -- something I'm very grateful for. I slept off while listening to a &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_tells_us_why_we_love_cheat?language=en"&gt;third TED talk&lt;/a&gt; of the afternoon. I really enjoyed &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en"&gt;one of the talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, that talked about "choice". I found the talk interesting because I could easily agree with the speaker's postulations. During his presentation, the speaker, Barry Schwartz said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was woken from my sleep afterwards by my pastor's son, Tosin. He had been sent to fetch me. My pastor's wife and children had to travel the following morning, so needed some gas in their car for the trip. For this I drove out to get some petrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just before I could drive out, an incidence caused some delay. His son had carelessly locked the car key in the vehicle; alas, there were no spare keys. So this became the hurdle we had to face for the next 30-45 minutes. What's more: he had ignited the vehicle just before locking it in, so the car was running the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, with the help of a few folks -- good thing to be a &lt;em&gt;good pastor&lt;/em&gt;; lots of folks came around to help very quickly -- we got a metal bar into the door and removed the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over two hours later, I got the fuel, but not while I drove around searching. I had returned in disappointment and parked the car. In our little gas-haunting adventure, we had failed to obtain that which we sought for owing to general scarcity. In fact, on three occasions, we were told that the fuel in the station's supply was exhausted when it was only a couple of cars to our turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In eventual frustration, I managed to get the car back home with the little fuel left in it. Afterwards, I left with my gallon in a commercial tricycle headed in a different direction as the one I had previously traveled in. Surprisingly, I met a newly opened petrol station only a minute or two into the journey. They were eagerly distributing the scarce commodity to their new customers; I too joined the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a different note, my sister returned home from my cousins' a few minutes before I got back home. She came back with a diary and calender for me, which I very much appreciate. What I need to complete that set is a wrist-watch in a bid to be well organised in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Last night, a few hours before 12AM, we (me and my aunt's family) were at the church. Church service lasted till just after new year -- about 12.20AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got home and I broke my day-long food break (no pun intended). I had some malt (Amstel Malta) -- I didn't get one to buy at the time we left church. I would later refuse to take any of the fizzy drinks offered during lunch because of this; plus I felt (for sentimental reasons) that my aunt might not have been pleased I took one of the malt drinks (there were four cans, and I had one of them) in the refrigerator -- and milk (Hollandia Milk, sold for 130 naira). We had prayers, and then it was the next meal round for me. I had some &lt;em&gt;garri&lt;/em&gt; and chicken, which of course, my aunt handed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, getting up at about 6AM, we kick started the day. We were to attend church is the practice at my aunt's church. I have partaken in that, the last two years. So I went on to wash the two cars -- my aunts' and her husbands'. We left the house after 9 O'Clock, and when we arrived at the church, it was already 10AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first-day-of-the-year program is usually geared towards the announcement of a new &lt;strong&gt;anchor&lt;/strong&gt; -- something we chant in faith, at the end of every church service, all year round. Amongst other things, the anchor's declaration is usually preceded by about three prophecies. And so it was today. The announcement came in the third: &lt;strong&gt;"O God: Thou art my HELP, and my DELIVERER"&lt;/strong&gt;; a declaration drawn out of Psalm 70 vs 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rest of the family, I left the church after 4PM, after having stayed in traffic for about an hour. We had left Folabi and Dapo -- two of my cousins -- at the church. They would much later, much to their surprise, find their way home themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, I got a call from my pastor -- Pastor Odusina -- to check up on his phone, and help fix an issue. Alas, the issue was that his newly installed Skype app wasn't connecting to the internet, and was displaying an "offline" status. When, I got there, it just worked without me touching it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently helped purchase a new smartphone for my pastor's wife, and offered to help diagnose her laggy old phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were the activities that took up most of my evening, even until just before now (current system time: 21.54) that I'm writing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to hack some code tonight, but there is no power supply at the moment; this battery'll only last a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my plans for 2016, I hope to read a paper a day as a way to become ever more read and deepen my insight in my autodidactic journey. I haven't read any today, but I found some &lt;a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love"&gt;very awesome resource on Github&lt;/a&gt;, a curation of computer science based academic papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am crowdsourcing for paper suggestions. I welcome you to contribute your to-read paper/essay suggestions in the comments. I also have &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-recommended-list-of-essays-papers-to-read-one-per-day-in-2016-for-an-autodidact-who-wants-to-widen-his-horizon-but-focus-on-Soft-Engr?share=1"&gt;this question on Quora&lt;/a&gt; where you may also post your answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Quora, I found &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Obinna-Okechukwu"&gt;this really interesting profile&lt;/a&gt; on Quora minutes after returning from the new year cross-over church service. He has a &lt;a href="https://tcsnotes.quora.com/"&gt;Quora-hosted blog&lt;/a&gt;, where he reviews or puts details of Computer Science papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/James-L-Moyer?share=1"&gt;this other guy&lt;/a&gt; -- creator of &lt;a href="http://www.TheAutodidactLife.com"&gt;AutodidactLife&lt;/a&gt; -- who encouraged me to read transcripts of TED talks. His answers on Quora show that he has some insightful knowledge on autodidactism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More personally, I didn't speak with my mum today -- something I find rather strange for the first day of the year, but I did call my grandma and sister. My sister, Tobi, is with a cousin (Aunt Ladun) for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="life"></category><category term="journal"></category><category term="diary"></category><category term="january"></category><category term="first day"></category><category term="church"></category><category term="fast"></category><category term="family"></category><category term="pastor"></category></entry></feed>
