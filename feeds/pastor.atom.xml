My sleep was a rather short one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the devotion, I got ready for church service. I got to the church at exactly 9AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't called up to interpret during the service, in fact, no youth was. The interpretion was done by one of the elders, Elder Ogunkomaya. I would think this had to do with the service being the first Sunday service for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the first Sunday of the year, one would expect some sort of thanksgiving service. That it was, but only slightly. I guess the full package isn't until the first Sunday in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two prophecies, and one of them mentioned that, the service need not be rushed. This is worthy of note because, prior to both prophecies, the pastor had asked the prophets to keep their prophecies short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sermon was tagged "Unselfish Desires ...". While I particularly liked this topic, I wasn't very pleased with some of the prayers that followed. They sounded contradictory to the theme of the sermon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I had siesta. I slept off while listening to a &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_tells_us_why_we_love_cheat?language=en"&gt;third TED talk&lt;/a&gt; of the afternoon. I really enjoyed &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en"&gt;one of the talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, that talked about "choice". I found the talk interesting because I could easily agree with the speaker's postulations. During his presentation, the speaker, Barry Schwartz said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was woken from my sleep afterwards by my pastor's son, Tosin. He had been sent to fetch me. My pastor's wife and children had to return to their workstation the following, so needed some gas in their car for the trip. For this I drove out to get some petrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit delay before I got move the car out of their compound was caused by his son who had carelessly locked the only car key in vehicle. So this became the hurdle we had to face for the next 30-45 minutes. What's more: he had ignited the vehicle before locking it in, so the car was running the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, with the help of a few folks -- good thing to be a good pastor; lots of folks came around to help very quickly -- we got a metal bar into the door and removed the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over two hours later, I got the fuel, but not while I drove around searching. In fact, we had narrowly missed fuel at about three pumps, where I was told "the fuel was exhausted" just before it got to my turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed the little fuel left in the car back home, then left in a commercial tricycle headed in a different direction as the one I had previously travelled in. Surprisingly, I met a newly opened petrol station only a minute or two into the journey, happily distributing the scarce commodity to her new customers, then I joined the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister returned home from my cousins' a few minutes before I got back home. She came back with a diary and calender for me, which I very much appreciate. What I need to complete that set is a wrist-watch in a bid to have my well rounded 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Last night, a few hours before 12AM, we (me and my aunt's family) were at the church. Church service lasted till just after new year -- about 12.20AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got home and I broke my day-long food break (no pun intended). I had some malt (Amstel Malta) -- I didn't get one to buy at the time we left church. I would later refuse to take any of the fizzy drinks offered during lunch because of this; plus I felt my aunt might not have been pleased I took one of the malt drinks (there were four cans, and I had one of them) in the refrigerator -- and milk (Hollandia Milk, sold for 130 naira). We had prayers, and then it was the next meal round for me. I had some &lt;em&gt;garri&lt;/em&gt; and chicken, which of course, my aunt handed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, getting up at about 6AM, we kick started the day. We were to attend church is the practice at my aunt's church. I have partaken in that, the last two years. So I went on to wash the two cars -- my aunts' and her husbands'. We left the house after 9 O'Clock, and when we arrived at the church, it was already 10AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first-day-of-the-year program is usually geared towards the announcement of a new &lt;strong&gt;anchor&lt;/strong&gt; -- something we chant in faith, at the end of every church service, all year round. Amongst other things, the anchor's declaration is usually preceded by about three prophecies. And so it was today. The announcement came in the third: &lt;strong&gt;"O God: Thou art my HELP, and my DELIVERER"&lt;/strong&gt;; a declaration drawn out of Psalm 70 vs 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rest of the family, I left the church after 4PM, after having stayed in traffic for about an hour. We had left Folabi and Dapo -- two of my cousins -- at the church. They would much later, much to their surprise, find their way home themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, I got a call from my pastor -- Pastor Odusina -- to check up on his phone, and help fix an issue. Alas, the issue was that his newly installed Skype app wasn't connecting to the internet, and was displaying an "offline" status. When, I got there, it just worked without me touching it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently helped purchase a new smartphone for my pastor's wife, and offered to help diagnose her laggy old phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were the activities that took up most of my evening, even until just before now (current system time: 21.54) that I'm writing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to hack some code tonight, but there is no power supply at the moment; this battery'll only last a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my plans for 2016, I hope to read a paper a day as a way to become ever more read and deepen my insight in my autodidactic journey. I haven't read any today, but I found some &lt;a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love"&gt;very awesome resource on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am crowdsourcing for paper suggestions. You can contribute your to-read paper/essay suggestions in the comments. I also have this question on Quora: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Quora, I found &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Obinna-Okechukwu"&gt;this really interesting profile&lt;/a&gt; on Quora minutes after returning from the new year cross-over church service. He has a &lt;a href="https://tcsnotes.quora.com/"&gt;Quora-hosted blog&lt;/a&gt;, where he reviews or puts details of Computer Science papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/James-L-Moyer?share=1"&gt;this other guy&lt;/a&gt; -- creator of &lt;a href="http://www.TheAutodidactLife.com"&gt;AutodidactLife&lt;/a&gt; -- who encouraged me to read transcripts of TED talks. His answers on Quora show that he has some insightful knowledge on autodidactism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More personally, I didn't speak with my mum today, but I did call my grandma and sister. My sister is with a cousin (Aunt Ladun) for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="life"></category><category term="journal"></category><category term="diary"></category><category term="january"></category><category term="first day"></category><category term="church"></category><category term="fast"></category><category term="family"></category><category term="pastor"></category></entry></feed>
